Remove everything that is in the  Tampermonkey script, And Paste "[sniper.js](https://github.com/Lunatic-T/WebSniperGameId/blob/main/sniper.js)" in it.

Click Ctrl + S once done (to save the script)


We'll Leave it at that for now. 


Download [Api.exe](https://github.com/Lunatic-T/WebSniperGameId/releases/tag/api) and run it (its just for getting the gameid, scan it with virustotal if ur scared)


Run api.exe 

if it tells you:

Now that this is done, Log in to Discord.com on Web if you didnt already. And after that, move over to the [sols rng biomes channel](https://discord.com/channels/1186570213077041233/1282542323590496277)

## (REQUIRED FOR SPEED)

Download Roblox From Microsoft Store 

Go to Settings -> Apps -> Default apps -> Search Roblox and click "Roblox" 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dff21140-0baf-4c00-8050-60377f624948)

Once this is done, keep Microsoft Roblox open on the Home Page.

Do not join a game or it will delay the sniper because roblox unloads the previous place before placing you in queue.
